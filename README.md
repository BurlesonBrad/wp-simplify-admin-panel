remove-menu-links-simply
========================

This plugin allows the website administrator to remove menu links from the WordPress admin menu (like Posts, Comments, etc.). It relies on hardcoded settings in wp-config.php instead of having yet another admin settings page to deal with. Since the settings are all hardcoded, it can be easily set up by a website administrator and left in place. It works on both single and multisite installations.
